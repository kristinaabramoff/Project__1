# Project__1
This project aims to investigate the factors influencing national happiness and trends over time. Key research questions include whether a country's happiness score correlates with its GDP per capita and if predicted life expectancy impacts happiness. Additionally, we will determine the happiest continent based on global happiness score. Furthermore, we will analyse happiness trends from 2018 to 2024 for specific countries like Australia, Spain, China, and the USA. Lastly, we also try to find is there a correlation between a country's unemployment rate and its national happiness score. By collecting and analysing relevant data on economic indicators, happiness metrics, and life expectancy, this study will provide insights into the socio-economic drivers of happiness and how they evolve over time across different regions.
